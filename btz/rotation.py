Keep the debuff from Mangle up.
Cast Tiger's Fury whenever it's available and you have 40 or less energy. ...
Cast Rip with 5 combo points, if you don't need to recast Savage Roar.
Cast Shred.

Maintain  Faerie Fire (Feral) Debuff on boss, if no other Druid is applying it.
Maintain  Savage Roar to increase all damage by 30%.
Use  Mangle to put the debuff up on the target.
Use  Shred as your main damage dealer, and filler ability.
At 5 Combo points, use  Rip as your secondary finisher, and make sure not to clip it.
Powershift in and out of Catform whenever you are more than 1 energy tick away from another ability with the macro /use !cat form.
 Mangle again only if it will allow you to Powershift sooner and you will not be waiting for a  Shred
